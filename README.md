Current Version of the site is 1.1.0


Improvments that were made in this version are:

1.Support for Desktop was added

2.Border to the image-carusel was added (in desktop mode)

3.Hover effects for h1s and h2s and h3s were added

4.Now, when you highlight the text, the background of it becomes pink (not blue like in 1.0.0)

5.Code looks much cleaner compare to the previous version
